      "The kiwi martini is a very fun vodka cocktail and it is one of the best drinks that makes use of fresh fruit. Though there are a few recipes floating around, this is one of the easiest and it is an absolutely delightful green martini to drink.\r\n\r\nFor this recipe, you'll simply muddle slices of kiwi with simple syrup, then shake it with vodka. It's a drink that anyone can mix up in minutes and a perfect cocktail to show off your favorite vodka.",
